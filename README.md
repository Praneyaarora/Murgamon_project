## Overview

**Problem:**
- Livestock farming is highly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks (avian influenza, swine fever, and more).
- Traditional surveillance is reactive; diagnosis occurs only when disease is visible, often too late to prevent large-scale losses.
- Biosecurity enforcement and compliance tracking remain tedious for farmers and regulators.
- Rapid disease spread threatens human health through zoonoses and ignites economic disruptions.

**Our Solution:**
- A comprehensive AI-IoT platform enabling real-time monitoring of animal health and farm biosecurity.
- Animal-wearable sensor tags for continuous vitals and traceability.
- Farm hub environmental monitoring with gas sensors, camera, and central control.
- Smart access system integrating RFID, sanitization (sprinkler), and automated entry/exit tracking.
- Machine learning models for predictive risk scoring, early outbreak detection, and actionable alerts.
- Multilingual dashboard for instant insights and compliance audit.
